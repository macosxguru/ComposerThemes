Themes for MultiMarkdown Composer

This is an attempt to replicate the look of iA Writer in Composer. 

**iaw light.theme**: This is the light version

**iaw dark.theme**: This is the dark version

These are derived from the default dark theme which shipped with Composer and the iA Writer theme which ships with the beta of **The Archive**.

I have made some changes to the default iA Writer look. You are welcome to adhere more closely to the original.
